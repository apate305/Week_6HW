Relational Database Management System or RDBMS for short,  is a software system that manages databases or tables. RDBMS is the foundation for SQL. The data in RDBMS is stored in tables which contain columns and rows. Each column has a name for the data attribute and each row has ONE value for each attributeâ€”this is known as a relational database.  A relational database usually has different tables and you can join the tables to extract relevant information and do investigations. 

SQL or Structured Query Language is a nonprocedural language. This means that you do not have to tell the interpreter how to solve the problem. You just need to tell SQL what you want.  This makes SQL different from Python which is procedural. SQL is a language that is used to communicate with tables/databases. The SQL statements/commands perform data related tasks like storing, manipulating and retrieving data.
